# Issue-Tracker

# Description
This is my work through the book Pro MERN Stack by Vasan Subramanian. This version i have added Material-UI to the application which is contrary to the book. I might create a second repository and use React Bootstrap as described in the book.

## What I liked about the book and coding this application
/* TO DO */

## What i didn't like about the book and coding this application
/* TO DO */

## Issues
I feel that I should talk about the issues that I had while coding and what the work around was. (at least what I remember)
